# Valorant Rank Discord Bot

A bot to check a user's rank in the current Valorant act, and later, to update their rank accordingly.

## Requirements

This bot is in an in-development state, and is intended currently to be run using devcontainers in vscode. This will help set up all required containers and dependencies.

## Setup

To get started, register an application with Discord, and add the client ID and bot token to a .env file in the root directory.

You can then start the application with `yarn run start`, and you will be provided an invite link to add the bot to your server.
